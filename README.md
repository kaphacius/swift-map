### Experimenting with SwiftUI+Map

##### To run the project you need to obtain a `client_key` and `client_secret` for Foursquare API.
1. Sign Up [here](https://foursquare.com/log-in/)
2. Go to [My (your) apps](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps).
3. Create an app.
4. Paste your `client_key` and `client_secret` into `SwiftUI_MapApp.swift`, lines `#18` and `#19` respectively. 
5. Delete `#warning` at line `#15` and you are good to go!
